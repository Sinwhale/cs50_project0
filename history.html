      <h3>Thousands of years ago, the gods ruled in their Celestial Court and observed their mortal creations from above without being entangled in their daily lives. Bahamut, the source of life, loved all the human races of Syngarcia and, in contradiction to the other gods, gave each realm one of his children. Ravaka was given to Athos, the eastern continent and Murra to Heevos, the western continent.</h3>

      <h3>Ravaka was born with a disease that never let her develop flight. Nevertheless, the world of Athos showed her love and adoration. However, her illness got worse and her father soon released her of the pain. Her flesh was buried deep in the earth and gave new life and fertility to the land. On the other side, the Theocrats of Hevor have recently seized power and grasped Bahamut's gift as a weapon. Young Murra grew up next to warlords and kings who fell one after another. Alchemies and experiments on the young dragon's body led to new paths of occult knowledge and magic. When Murra reached adulthood, the Theocrats managed to unbind his heart from his body and using its immense power to call a part of the Celestial Court over Heevos. The ancient city of Edenkand.</h3>

      <h3>Theocrating Heevos ready for expansion and bitter Athos after losing their own celestial dragon, begun to blur the images of their Gods and the pantheon lost its strength. The Heevoans now had a power over death with aspirations for further domination, and the Athoans in disbelief to the gods turned to development of defense against the imperialism of their new enemies. War broke out for decades until the day of the Apocalypse. The ancient city of Edenkand fell on top of Heevos as giant comet and Murra mysteriously transformed from their worshipped guardian into a giant flying doom that terrorized the world of Syngarcia for centuries.

      <h3>A group rose by the name of The Order of the Dawn that recruited soldiers to fight and defend against Murra. After the discovery of Sinmetal in the underground dwarven city of Undarog and Murra's weakness against it, the Order of the Dawn was given control of the ore veins. Weapons and armor of Sinmetal were crafted and an army was built that partially defended and rebuild the cities. In good faith they were given supreme authority and power over the two nations. Meantime, the army was preparing and building giant artillery to use against the dragon for Operation Dovar in South Athos, a grand assault designed to bait Murra into his end. The dragon was wounded but humanity's grandest army suffered immense loses. Operation Dovar was a massive defeat. Hope was starting to fade.</h3>

      <h3>Soon however, High Commander Edgam of the Order of the Dawn gathered whatever troops remained and brought them through the snowy ruins of Beloden where the dragon was tracked and gave their last battle against him. Edgam Ix Serras the sole survivor after that battle was victorious at the end as the dragon fell. He was crowned High King of both continents and ruled in peace for 500 years until today.</h3>
